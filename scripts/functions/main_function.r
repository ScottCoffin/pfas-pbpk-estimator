# Main Function


### Master Function
#The master function constructs a dataframe for a single iteration of MC variables, populates it and performs the serum calculations. By default, it returns only the last row of the dataframe (the final timestep).

#The following table defines the columns of the result dataframe:

# Column | Description | Formula
#-------|------------|---------------------------------------------
# Time | Exact model age (years)| Days/days_per_year
# Years| Years old| floor(Days/days_per_year)
# Months | Months old | floor(Days/days_per_month)
# Days | Days old| seq(1,total_steps,timestep), where total_steps = ceiling((ed-sd)/timestep)
# Date | Calendar date| seq(sd,ed,timestep)
# DWC | Drinking Water Concentration| MC varied concs looked up with water_concs_dates and set to 0 before 1960
# DWI | Drinking Water Intake| Mean DWI (looked up from source file) * MC varied DWI adjustment factor (DWIaf)
# BW | Body Weight | MC varied BW and the creation_date are used to select the individual's weight percentile at the current age. BW over time is looked up by age from that percentile
# Daily_Dose_DW | Daily Dose from Drinking Water| MC varied perc_tap looked up by date * (DWC/1000)*(DWI/1000)/BW. Set to 0 during breastfeeding and drinking store bought formula
# Vd | Volume of distribution, for each time t | Age_adjust * MC varied V_d. Age_adjust is an adjustment factor for the volume of distribution in children, otherwise it is 1
# Bkgd_serum | Background Serum | MC Varied BkgdF, BkgdM, BkgdFk, or BkgdMk when Days = 1, and a Time Step Adjustment (TSA) for Days > 1 to account for decay.
# Daily_Dose_BM | Daily Dose of Breast Milk. Only used for breastfeeding infants during breastfeeding |  (BMC)*(BMI/1000)/BW_i, where BMC is Breast Milk Concentration, calculated using mother's steady state serum concentration and MC varied MatXfer; BMI is Mean Breast Milk Intake for the infant, looked up from the source file; and BW_i is the Median Body Weight of infants looked up from the source file which differs by gender.
# Serum_b | Serum concentration before elimination | Bkgd_serum + TSA + timestep * (Daily_Dose_DW/Vd), for t = 1. For all t > 1, Serum_a[@t-1] + TSA + timestep * (Daily_Dose_DW/Vd). For infants this is initialized with the steady state value for mother's serum at the time of birth, using MC varied PlacXfer. The Serum_b calculation for infants includes an additional Daily_Dose_BM component. For adults, it is initialized with the background serum.
# Serum_a | Serum concentration after elimination | Serum_b * DecayPerStep. While women are breastfeeding, we substitute CRBFPerStep for DecayPerStep to add additional decay for breast milk clearance. These are calculated with MC varied Halflife, MC varied MilkClearnance and MC varied MatRemove
